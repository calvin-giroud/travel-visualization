The following program is a quick way to visualize the Traveling Salesman
problem and gives some real-word context and possible uses cases to the 
solutions to this problem. The one use case that this program explores in 
particular is planning vacation destinations. Given a starting (home) point and
a set if desired destinations to visit, what is the optimal flight path 
(using great-circle distance) as to visit each of these locations while 
minimizing distance traveled?

Client Interface:

Modify the 'Cities.txt' file in the containing folder to generate the list
of waypoints with new lines delimiting each location. The first location in
this file will used as the starting and ending point.

Using (Python Libraries):
Matplotlib
Basemap
Geopy
Numpy
Itertools

Update 5/15/2015:
Implemented dynamic programming TSP algorithm
Streamlined codebase
